# FetchAndWrite

I was undergoing a course in udemy where it was taught that you can fetch data from some site and write and then you can also write to a file.
The website used here was provided by the tutor and you can also fetch data from it. 
The link is "https://bluelimelearning.github.io/my-fav-quotes/".
Using beautifulSoup the data is fetched.
you can check out the BeautifulSoup scrapping file in the repo.
I have also uploaded the resulting csv file.
